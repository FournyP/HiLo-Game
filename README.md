# HiLo Game !

This repository contains a simple implementation of the HiLo game.

What's in my repo ?

- Client console
- Server logic

## Getting Started

To get started, build the solution as follows:

```bash
dotnet build
```

Then, run the server:

```bash
dotnet run --project HiLo.Server
```

Finally, run the client: (2 times to see the game in action!)

```bash
dotnet run --project HiLo.Client
```

## How to play ?
